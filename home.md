## Developer / Tinkerer / Absurdist d

I am a hobbyist software developer and a tinkerer.

For a brief period, I was in academia—at the Middlesex University, London—doing research, from where I obtained a BSc. in Computer Science (2008) and a PhD in Artificial Intelligence & Computational Linguistics (2011).

In 2013, I started the tech team at [Zerodha](https://zerodha.com), now India's largest stock broker, where I have been the CTO ever since. At Zerodha, we have an [unconventional team](https://zerodha.tech/blog/hello-world/) and we work on interesting financial technology projects.

I volunteer at several non-profit organisations, including the following ones that I co-founded:

- [FOSS United Foundation](https://fossunited.org) — started in 2020 to promote Free and Open Source Software communities and activities in India.
- [Rainmatter Foundation](https://rainmatter.org) — started in 2020 to back initiatives and projects in India focusing on ecological preservation and climate change.
- [Indic Digital Archive Foundation](https://indicarchive.org) — started in 2022. Works on Indic language computing projects and digital preservation of Indic language cultural artefacts such as books, publications, and documents.
- [Samagata Foundation](https://samagata.org) — setup in 2023 with the aim of backing initiatives and projects that cut across science, culture, art, technology, and education with a specific focus on the creation of public commons, institutions, and community spaces.

I identify strongly as an absurdist, a worldview that drives everything I do. I have a bleak view of the future thanks to human-made climate change, humanity's callous penchant for relentless extraction, environmental and ecological destruction, and its irrational hatred for fellow beings. And yet, somehow, I am not a dysfunctional pessimist.
